# Hello!

This is supposed to be a fun little project that takes yaml files from [duosmium](https://github.com/Duosmium/duosmium) to make different predictions and observations.
There is a .ipynb (notebook) file and .py file that do the same thing, the .py is used as utility while the notebook is meant to be used for demonstration. 

[Accurate Adjustment with Dropping Scores](demos/drops.ipynb)
